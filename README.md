A simple website  built with plain html, CSS, and bootstrap and small JavaScript


I had my days of little beginnings, yes, I wrote some pretty bad code and I admit same; it's all part of the learning phase. Yes, I know that this is a very badly written code but I have learnt with way more resources and I now know better.


When time permits, I will update this code.
